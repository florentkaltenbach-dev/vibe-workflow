# Mission

## What is this?
A multiplayer Scrabble game accessible through a web browser, hosted on a local web server.

## Who is it for?
Multiple players who want to play Scrabble together on a local network.

## Why does this exist?
To provide a convenient, accessible way for people to play Scrabble together without physical boards, using devices they already have (browsers).

## Core Experience
Players connect to a local server via their browsers and play classic Scrabble rules together in real-time.

## Non-Goals
- Not a mobile app
- Not a public/cloud-hosted service
- Not a single-player game with AI opponents (at least initially)
