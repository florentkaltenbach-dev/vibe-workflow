# Donation Vision: Luxury Free Software

## Why Does This Exist?

This project exists at the intersection of three beliefs:

1. **Beauty should be free**. Great design shouldn't be locked behind paywalls. Art Deco elegance, thoughtful interactions, and joyful experiences should be available to anyone with a browser.

2. **Local multiplayer is sacred**. In an age of cloud services and always-online demands, gathering around a shared game on a local network is an act of digital intimacy. No servers tracking you, no accounts, no surveillance—just people playing together.

3. **Craftsmanship deserves support**. While the software is free, the labor of creating something beautiful is real. People who value craft should have a dignified way to support it.

## The Central Question

**Should quality software that respects users always cost money, or can generosity sustain excellence?**

This project is a philosophical experiment: Can we build something so well-crafted, so respectful of users, and so beautiful that people *want* to support it—not because they must, but because they believe in what it represents?

## What Is "Luxury Free Software"?

Luxury free software means:

- **Free in perpetration**: Every feature works. No artificial limitations. No "upgrade to unlock." No ads. No tracking. No guilt.

- **Designed with reverence**: Art Deco aesthetics aren't just decoration—they're a statement that users deserve beauty. Every animation, every transition, every typographic choice honors the player's time and attention.

- **Technically impeccable**: Fast, secure, accessible, well-tested. Quality that would make software engineers weep with joy. Open-source code that serves as a teaching artifact.

- **Donation-worthy by excellence**: People support this not out of obligation, but because it demonstrates what's possible when craft matters more than extraction.

## Value Proposition

## Donation Philosophy: Respect Over Manipulation

### Core Principles

**1. Transparency Without Theater**
- Donations fund continued development and hosting of resources (dictionaries, documentation)
- Honest about costs: "Hosting the dictionary API costs $X/month"
- Honest about motivations: "This takes time, and support allows more features"
- Never inflated urgency ("Only 3 days left!" when there's no deadline)

**2. Gratitude Without Guilt**
- Thank donors genuinely and privately
- No public donor counts that shame non-donors
- No "X people donated today, will you?" pressure
- No blocking features while nagging for donations

**3. Beauty Without Obligation**
- Donation prompt is a small, elegant element
- Designed to match the Art Deco aesthetic
- Never interrupts gameplay
- Easy to dismiss, hard to guilt-trip

**4. Recognition Without Hierarchy**
- No "premium donor" badges that create classes
- No public leaderboards of donors
- Optional: Thank donors in a credits file, with permission only
- Recognition is private: a thank-you email, not a status symbol

### Implementation Constraints

**What We WILL Do:**
- Single, tasteful donation button in main menu (styled as Art Deco element)
- Optional "About" page explaining the project's philosophy
- Thank-you message after donation (one-time, elegant)
- Honest transparency report (quarterly, if donations exist): "Costs: $X, Donated: $Y, Time invested: Z hours"

**What We Will NEVER Do:**
- Pop-ups or interruptions during gameplay
- Countdown timers or artificial urgency
- Feature limitations based on donation status
- "Suggested donation amounts" that anchor high
- Tracking who donated vs. who didn't
- Email campaigns begging for donations
- "This software will shut down without support" threats (dishonest if untrue)

## Donation Experience Design

### Visual Design
A single button in the main menu:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│   ╔═══════════════════════╗    │
│   ║   SUPPORT THIS WORK   ║    │
│   ╚═══════════════════════╝    │
│                                 │
│   Entirely optional.            │
│   Always free.                  │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Styled in Art Deco:
- Geometric border with stepped edges
- Brass/gold accent color
- Small, unobtrusive
- One-click to donation page

### Donation Page Content

**Header:**
"Thank You for Considering Support"

**Body (honest, brief, respectful):**
"This Scrabble game is free and always will be. Every feature works. No ads, no tracking, no accounts.

Creating and maintaining this takes time:
- Design and development: ~200 hours
- Hosting dictionary API: ~$5/month
- Ongoing maintenance and improvements

If you find value in software that respects you, a donation helps sustain this work and signals that ethical, beautiful software is worth creating.

Donations are processed through [Ko-fi/Liberapay/GitHub Sponsors—whichever is most ethical], and I never see your email unless you choose to share it."

**Suggested Amounts (if required by platform):**
- $3 - A coffee's worth of thanks
- $10 - Meaningful support
- $25 - Generous investment
- Custom amount

**After Donation:**
"Thank you. Your support means this work can continue. You'll receive no emails unless you opted in. Enjoy the game."

### Credits/About Page (Optional)

A simple page accessible from main menu:

## Success Metrics (Non-Donation)

We measure success not by donations, but by:

1. **Quality**: Test coverage >90%, zero critical security issues, WCAG AA compliance
2. **Respect**: Zero dark patterns, zero tracking, zero compromises to user autonomy
3. **Beauty**: Subjective, but: Does it feel luxurious? Would designers be proud?
4. **Utility**: Do people actually play it? Is it reliable?
5. **Inspiration**: Does it demonstrate what's possible? Does it teach others?

Donations are a *signal* of success, not the definition of it.

## What Donations Enable (Honest Roadmap)

**Without donations (baseline commitment):**
- Core game remains free and functional
- Security patches and critical bug fixes
- Source code remains open and available

**With modest donations ($50-100/month):**
- Continued feature development (save/load, chat, challenges)
- Better documentation and tutorials
- Hosting for shared resources (dictionary API endpoint for those who want it)

**With significant donations ($500+/month):**
- Additional game modes (team play, tournament mode)
- Additional languages and dictionaries
- Professional accessibility audit and improvements
- Video tutorials on the development process
- Support for contributors and community maintenance

**Never, regardless of donations:**
- Paid features
- Ads or sponsorships
- User tracking for monetization
- Compromises to the core principles

## The Philosophical Bet

This project bets that:

1. **Quality compounds**: A beautifully-made, respectful game will attract users organically
2. **Respect reciprocates**: People who feel respected (not manipulated) are more likely to support
3. **Transparency builds trust**: Honest costs and motivations create genuine relationships
4. **Beauty inspires generosity**: When people see craft, they want to sustain it

If this bet fails—if donations are minimal or non-existent—the project still succeeds on its own terms. It will have proven that luxury free software can exist, even if it can't be fully sustained through generosity alone.

## Constraints (From Parent Document)

### Must Never Violate
- **Must remain fully functional without payment**: Every feature, always
- **Must never guilt-trip**: No "We'll shut down without you" messaging
- **Must preserve privacy**: No tracking donors vs. non-donors
- **Must maintain beauty**: Donation UI matches Art Deco aesthetic
- **Must stay honest**: True costs, true motivations, true transparency

### Escalation Conditions

**Escalate to /root if:**
- Donation approach feels manipulative (violates core principles)
- Quality standards cannot be met with available resources (need scope reduction)
- Community pressure to add "premium features" (requires philosophical discussion)

**Escalate to /1-design if:**
- Donation UI doesn't match aesthetic standards
- User flow for donations creates friction or confusion

**Escalate to /4-security if:**
- Donation platform introduces tracking or privacy concerns
- Payment processing requires compromising user data

## The North Star

**We build this as if donations will never come, so that when they do, they come for the right reasons.**

The quality must stand on its own. The beauty must be intrinsic. The respect must be unconditional. Donations are the applause after the performance, not the price of admission.

## Summary for Other Personalities

When designing, implementing, or testing this game:

**Ask yourself:**
- "Is this feature so well-made that someone would voluntarily support its existence?"
- "Does this respect the user's time, attention, and autonomy?"
- "Would I be proud to show this to a master craftsperson?"

If the answer is no, it's not ready. The luxury is in the details. The freedom is in the respect. The donation-worthiness is in the integrity of both.
