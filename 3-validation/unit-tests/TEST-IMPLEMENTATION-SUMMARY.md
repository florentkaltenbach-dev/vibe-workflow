## Security Testing

The test suite includes security validation tests:

### DEBT-001 Security Tests (Input Sanitization)
- ✅ **validation.test.ts:** Tests rejection of malicious tile letters (XSS prevention)
- ✅ Validates integration with security/input-sanitization.ts module
- ✅ Tests address Threat Model T1.3 (Malicious Tile Letters)

**Security Coverage:**
- XSS injection via tile letters: COVERED
- Invalid tile letter format: COVERED
- Tile letter validation: COVERED

---

## Notable Implementation Details

### 1. Security Integration
The validation tests include a specific test case for the newly added security validation:
```typescript
it('should reject invalid tile letter (security check)', () => {
  const placements = [
    { row: 7, col: 7, tile: { letter: '<script>', points: 1, isBlank: false } },
  ];
  const result = validatePlacement(placements, board, true);
  expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
  expect(result.error).toContain('Invalid tile letter');
});
```

This test validates that DEBT-001 (Input Sanitization) has been addressed in the tile validation logic.

### 2. Randomness Testing
Tests for shuffling (tile bag, player order) verify randomness without being flaky:
```typescript
it('should shuffle tiles randomly', () => {
  const bag1 = initializeTileBag();
  const bag2 = initializeTileBag();
  const identical = bag1.every((tile, i) =>
    tile.letter === bag2[i].letter && tile.points === bag2[i].points
  );
  expect(identical).toBe(false); // Very unlikely with proper shuffle
});
```

### 3. Complex Scoring Tests
Tests validate scoring multiplier order of operations:
```typescript
it('should apply letter multipliers before word multipliers', () => {
  // (0,0) is triple word, (0,3) is double letter
  // C(3) + A(1) + R(1) + T(1×2) = 7, then ×3 = 21
  expect(score).toBe(21);
});
```

### 4. Game State Mutation Tests
Tests verify that game state is properly mutated:
```typescript
it('should advance turn after valid play', () => {
  // ... setup ...
  gameEngine.submitWord(gameState, '1', placements, dictionary);
  expect(gameState.currentPlayerIndex).toBe(1); // Verifies mutation
});
```

## Issues Discovered (ESCALATION NOTES)

### No Bugs Found ✅
All implemented tests validate the implementation against the TEST-SPECS.md specifications. **No bugs or logic errors were discovered during test implementation.**

### Code Quality Observations
1. **Good:** Implementation follows specifications exactly
2. **Good:** Security validation properly integrated (DEBT-001 partially addressed)
3. **Good:** Clear separation of concerns between modules
4. **Good:** Type safety with TypeScript
5. **Good:** Immutability patterns where appropriate (board copies in scoring/validation)

### No Escalations Required ✅
- All interfaces are clear and well-defined
- All edge cases are handled in implementation
- No security vulnerabilities found beyond already-tracked DEBT-001
- No performance issues observed in test execution

## Test Maintenance Notes for Future Developers

### When to Update Tests

1. **Interface Changes:** If /1-design/interfaces changes, update test expectations
2. **Logic Changes:** If /2-logic/pseudocode changes, update test scenarios
3. **Security Rules:** If /4-security adds new validations, add corresponding tests
4. **Premium Squares:** If board layout changes, update board.test.ts

### Adding New Tests

Follow this pattern:
```typescript
describe('FunctionName', () => {
  describe('when [specific condition]', () => {
    it('should [expected behavior]', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = setupInput();

      // Act
      const result = functionUnderTest(input);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Data
- Use realistic game scenarios
- Test boundary values (0, 1, 14, 15 for board positions)
- Test with actual tile distributions
- Test with real dictionary words
